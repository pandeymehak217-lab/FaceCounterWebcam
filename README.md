# FaceCounterWebcam
This project demonstrates a real-time human face detection system using Python, OpenCV, and a Deep Learning-based DNN model (SSD + Caffe). Unlike traditional Haar cascades, this model detects only human faces with higher accuracy, reducing false positives. The system works with your webcam and displays a live face count.
